\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In this research assignment, I replicate a research assignment by Gert
Peersman (2005), a German economist, titled ``What caused the early
millennium slowdown? Evidence based on vector autoregressions''. In this
paper, Peersman (2005) uses a simple four-variable VAR (vector
autogressive model) and an identification based scheme based on sign
restrictions to examine the effects of a supply, demand, monetary policy
and oil price shocks. Peersman (2005) uses data from the United States
and Euro area. However, this assignment will only focus on analyzing
shocks for the USA. Peersman (2005) concludes that the millennial
slowdown is not the result of one particular shock, but a combination of
them. The goal of this assignment is to replicate the results of
Peersman (2005) as well as preform additional robustness test to ensure
the validity of Peermans (2005) results.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

\end{itemize}

This paper is structured as follows: The first section will give an
overview of the paper with respects to the economics, methodology and
data that Peersman (2005) used. The second section will replicate the
results for the US. The third section will perform robustness checks and
the forth section will conclude.

\hypertarget{overview-of-the-paper}{%
\section{Overview of the paper}\label{overview-of-the-paper}}

This section gives a brief overview of the economics of Peersman (2005)
and a critical evaluation of the statistical approach that Peersman
(2005) choose to analyze possible causes for the economic slowdown of
the US.

\hypertarget{literature-review}{%
\subsection{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}}

The 1990s was the start of an economic boom for the United States as
they experienced the unusual combination of rapid output growth and
extremely low and stable inflation. From 1994 to 2002 the United States
real GDP grew by an average annual rate of almost 4 percent while annual
inflation was less than 2 percent. However, by the end of 2001, the US
began to experience negative growth (Peersman, 2005). Since 2001, the US
economy has not experienced close to the same economic growth. It is
therefore important to understand what caused the slowdown.

The economic expansion that the US experienced made headlines as it was
the longest expansion in economic history. Many explanations have been
offered as to why the US experienced such rapid growth, but overall, it
is attributed to numerous factors. Productivity growth increased
tremendously which created a favorable investment environment. The
private investment opportunities contributed to the advancements in
technologies and inspired innovation (Weller, 2002). Furthermore, the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) created an environment for the
Federal Reserve to keep inflation rates low and stable (Taylor, 1998).

Another possible reason is that the US economy mostly experienced
positive shocks during the late 1990s. The Fed has the responsibility to
responds to shocks to the economy to ensure that output, employment, and
inflation remain stable. The Fed can easily respond to a demand shock as
it pushed output, employment, and inflation in the same direction.
Therefore, the Fed will lower interest rate which will increase money
supply to combat the effects of a demand shock. However, supply shock,
such as an increase in oil prices, are more complicated to respond. With
the threat of a recession, the Fed will need to decide whether to
prioritize inflation stability or employment stability. Which attributed
the economic boom that the US experienced, is the fact that large supply
shocks were uncommon during the 1990s.

After 10 years of economic growth, the US economy entered a recession.
The 2001/2002 was relatively short lived. Kliesen (2003) argues that the
recession was caused by shocks to investment by businesses and
households and by a decline in real net exports. However, Kleisen (2003)
does recognize that it can be extremely difficult to challenging to
discover the root cause of a recession. Understanding fluctuation in the
growth of an economy has been research by many economists but it is
still relatively poorly understood. Therefore, Peersman (2005) adds
value to research by examining four shocks (oil, demand, supply, and
monetary policy) to analyze the origin of the slowdown.

Peersman (2005) concludes that the slowdown of economic growth was
caused by a combination of several shocks. This conclusion is
non-surprising and therefore Peersman (2005) main contribution is the
impressive mathematical and statistical analysis that he performed.

\hypertarget{data-and-methodology}{%
\subsection{Data and Methodology}\label{data-and-methodology}}

This paper used quarterly data from 1980 to 2002 on the US consumer
expenditure index (CPUS), real GDP (YUS), short term nominal interest
rate (SUS) as well as data on the oil price (OIL). Changes in CPUS
record the rate of consumer inflation while changes in YUS record output
growth. The data is then manipulated to display the first difference of
the log of OIL, YUS and CPUS and these variables are assumed to be I(1)
variables. The SUS variable is taken as an I(0) variable (Ouliaris,
Pagan \& Restrepo, 2018). The data is presented in figure 2.1 below.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{replication_files/figure-latex/Figure1-1} 

}

\caption{Data\label{Figure1}}\label{fig:Figure1}
\end{figure}

Peersman (2005) estimates a four-variable constant-coefficient vector
autpregression (VAR) model, with three lags and identifies four shocks.
The variables included in the analysis is the first difference of oil
prices, output growth measured by the real GDP index, consumer inflation
measured by consumer price index and short-term nominal interest rates.
The four shocks that are analyzed in this paper; two supply shocks, one
demand shock and one monetary policy shock. The two supply shocks
represents a shock to the oil price and a shock to output growth. The
demand shock is associated with a shock to consumer inflation (CPUS),
while the monetary policy shock is associated with a shock to the short
term nominal interest rate. Taking the four varaibles and shocks into
account, the equation can be presented as follows:

\[\begin{bmatrix} \Delta oil_t \\ \Delta y_t \\ \Delta p_t \\ s_t \end{bmatrix} = \Biggl[ I - \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i \Biggl]^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} b_{11}& b_{12}& b_{13} & b_{14} \\
b_{21}& b_{22}& b_{23} & b_{24} \\
b_{31}& b_{32}& b_{33} & b_{34} \\
b_{41}& b_{42}& b_{43} & b_{44} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_t^{oil} \\ \epsilon_t^{s} \\ \epsilon_t^{d} \\ \epsilon_t^{m} \end{bmatrix}\]

Where \(\Delta oil_t\), \(\Delta y_t\) and \(\Delta p_t\) represent the
first difference of the price of oil, output growth and the consumer
prices respectively. \(s_t\) represents the short term nominal interest
rate. The oil price, demand, supply and monetary shock in represented by
\(\epsilon_t^{oil}\), \(\epsilon_t^{d}\), \(\epsilon_t^{s}\) and
\(\epsilon_t^{m}\) respectively.

Peersman (2005) assumes that the variables follow a covariance
stationary process. He uses the Dickey fuller test to reject the null
hypothesis of the existence of a unit root at a 10 percent level for
OIL, YUS and CPUS, however, the null hypothesis for interest rates
cannot be rejected. Peersman (2005) makes the assumption that interest
rates are stationary since the nominal rate cannot have a unit root if
both the real rate and inflation are stationary. This assumption will be
intensely analyzed in section xx during which I will preform numerous
robustness checks.

The paper makes use of a traditional identification strategy using a
combination of short-run and long-run restrictions. For the purpose of
this assignment, the short-run and long-run restrictions will be
discussed and modeled separately. Peersman (2005) assumes that there is
a contemporaneous impact of an oil shock on all variables in the VAR,
but no immediate impact of other shocks on oil prices. This assumption
is consistent with previous literature. Further Peersman (2005) adds the
restrictions that a monetary policy shock has no contemporaneous effect
on output, since monetary policy shocks have a temporary effect on
output. To model these contemporaneous effects
\(b_{12} = b_{13} = b_{14} = b_{24} = 0\). However, to accurately model
the contempoarous effects, the VAR needs \([k^2-k]/2\) restrictions,
where k represents the number of variables. This implies that a further
two contemporaneous effects are needed to model the short-run and long
run restrictions further. I will argue two more contemporaneous effects
that are consistent with past literature in the next section. Taking
into account only the contemporanous effects that Peersman (2005)
specifically specified in his paper, your matrix will change to:

\[\ \begin{bmatrix} b_{11}& 0 & 0 & 0 \\
b_{21}& b_{22}& b_{23} & 0 \\
b_{31}& b_{32}& b_{33} & b_{34} \\
b_{41}& b_{42}& b_{43} & b_{44} \end{bmatrix} \]

Peersman (2005) follows Blanchard and Quah (1989), Gali (1992) and
Gerlach and Smeth (1995) to add long-run restrictions to the model. He
assumes that demand shock has a permanent zero long-run effect of output
growth YUS. Furthermore, Peersman (2005) assumes that monetary shocks
has a zero long-run impact on output growth but a non-zero effect of OIL
and CPUS. Therefore, your long-run restriction matrix will be
represented as follow;

\[\ \begin{bmatrix} *& *& *& * \\
*& *& 0 & 0 \\
*& *& *& * \\
*& *& * & * \end{bmatrix} \]

where the zero's represent restrictions. In the next section I present
and evaluate impulse response functions that are correlated with the VAR
specified by Peersman (2005).

\hypertarget{evaluating-the-economic-slowdown}{%
\section{Evaluating the Economic
Slowdown}\label{evaluating-the-economic-slowdown}}

In this section, I use Peersman (2005) data on the US to plot impulse
response function taking into account the short run and long run
restrictions specified.

\hypertarget{short-run-restrictions}{%
\subsection{Short run restrictions}\label{short-run-restrictions}}

In Peersman (2005) he applies four short run restrictions to his VAR.
Since we have 4 variables in our VAR, 6 restrictions are required to
examine the VAR correctly. Therefore, I add two short run restrictions
in additional to Peersmans restrictions. The first restriction I add is
that a shock to consumer inflation, a demand shock, has contemporaneous
affect on output growth (YUS). Peersman (2005) specifies that a monetary
policy shock has no contemporaneous effect on output, and since monetary
policy shocks are a combination of money demand and exchange rate
shocks, this restriction is valid.

The second restriction I add is that a monetary policy shock has no
contemporaneous effect on consumer inflation. This restriction is
supported by McMillin (2001) who studied the the effect of monetary
policy shocks on macroeconomic variables. McMillin (2001) argued that
monetary policy shocks only affect consumer inflation with a lag,
therefore there will be no affect in the short-run. Therefore the matrix
for the contemporaneous coefficient will have the following formation;

\[\ \begin{bmatrix} b_{11}& 0 & 0 & 0 \\
b_{21}& b_{22}& 0 & 0 \\
b_{31}& b_{32}& b_{33} & 0 \\
b_{41}& b_{42}& b_{43} & b_{44} \end{bmatrix} \]

This matrix expresses that only shocks to OIL can shift OIL
contemporaneously. Only shock to OIL and YUS can shift output growth
(YUS) contemporaneously. Only shocks to OIL, YUS and CPUS and shift
consumer inflation contemporaneously and all shock can affect the
interest rate contemporaneously. I will now examine how each variable
responds to a the four different shocks, where each structural shock is
of size one. First, I will examine the effects of an oil shock.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{replication_files/figure-latex/Figure2-1} 

}

\caption{Response of Oil Price\label{Figure2}}\label{fig:Figure2}
\end{figure}

Figure 3.1 shows how oil responds to the four shocks discussed in the
previous section. We can derive that no shock has a permanent effect on
the price of oil, with a demand shock (CPUS) and supply shock (YUS)
increasing the price of oil more than the size of the structural shock
in the short run, while a monetary policy shock (SUS) decreases the
price of oil. Therefore, the response of oil to the four shocks is
insignificant in the long run. A positive demand and supply shock
increase the price of oil, which is the same results Peersman (2005)
arrived at in his analysis. Figure 3.2 represents output growth response
to the four different shocks.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{replication_files/figure-latex/Figure3-1} 

}

\caption{Response of Output growth\label{Figure3}}\label{fig:Figure3}
\end{figure}

Output growth has a strong negative response to a demand, oil and
monetary policy shock, where the pass-through of an demand shock is much
slower then the other shocks. A monetary policy shock first has a slight
positive effect on output, before it starts diminishing, which is
consistent with Khan (2008) analysis. The negative impact that an
increase in oil price has on output growth is also consistent with
literature. Jiménez-Rodríguez and Sánchez (2005) found a negative
relationship on an increase in oil price on economic activity for oil
importing countries. I will now analyse the response of consumer
inflation to the four different shocks are displayed in figure 3.4 below

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{replication_files/figure-latex/Figure4-1} 

}

\caption{Consumer Expenditure Index\label{Figure4}}\label{fig:Figure4}
\end{figure}

AS seen in Figure 3.4, consumer expenditure index which represents
consumer inflation, responds positively to all shocks. The oil price
shock has a small and insignificant effect on inflation as the increase
in inflation is short-lived. During the 1970's, oil prices increased
dramatically which encouraged the adoption of energy-saving technology
which lead to the importance of oi decreasing (Bachmeier \& Cha, 2011).
The positive effect that monetary policy has on inflation is
unsurprising as inflation immediately increases in response to an
increase in interest rates and then slowly decreases. Therefore, the
small effect of an oil shock and monetary policy shock on inflation is
consistent with literature. Lastly, the response of interest rates to
all four shocks are analysed in figure 3.5 below.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{replication_files/figure-latex/Figure5-1} 

}

\caption{Interest Rate Response\label{Figure5}}\label{fig:Figure5}
\end{figure}

Figure 3.5 replicate Peersman (2005) results as Peersman adds no
contemporaneous or long-run restrictions on short-term nominal interest
rates. An oil shock increases interest rates temporarily to
counterbalance the inflationary pressure. The demand and supply shock
has a positive effect on short-term nominal interest rates with the
effect slowly diminishing over time. These results are consistent with
literature. In the next section, I will analyze the effects of the long
run restrictions.

\hypertarget{long-run-restrictions}{%
\subsection{Long run restrictions}\label{long-run-restrictions}}

To implemented the long-run restrictions specified by Peersman (2005), I
implement an identification scheme proposed by Blanchard-Quah (1989). In
the original model, the assumption is made that demand shock has no
effect on the long run levels of output. Peersman (2005) makes the same
assumption is his paper. In order to make the implementation of
Blachard-Quah successful, I need to make an additional four long run
restrictions. I assume that all shocks, except an oil price shock, have
no long run impact on the price of oil. Furthermore, I assume that a
monetary policy shock has no long run impact on consumer inflation.
Therefore, my long run restriction matrix will take the following

\[\ \begin{bmatrix} *& 0& 0 & 0\\
*& *& 0 & 0 \\
*& *& *& 0 \\
*& *& * & * \end{bmatrix} \]

Argue that authors do no make use of a simple VAR but rather a

First VAR analysis that Peersman does is based on conventional zero

is a contemporaneous impact of an oil shock on all other variables in
the system, but no immediate impact of the other shocks on oil

Gideon suggested I only do the replication for the US, since this will

\#Optimal lag length

I now determine the optimal lag length for an unrestricted VAR with a
maximum lag length of 10.

According to the AIC and the FPE, the optimal lag length is 4. However,
the SC and HQ criterion indicates an optimal lag length of 1. The data
estimates a VAR including a constant and a trend as deterministic
regressor.

I will use a VAR with lag length eual to one as specified by the paper.

The results for diagnostic test for VAR(1), VAR(2) and VAR(3) are
provided in the table below.

Here you look and interpret all the test to determine whether VAR(1) is
too restrictive. ARGUE this as part of your robustness test for the
paper.
